# Image-Background-Remove-and-Change
This is the Image Background Remove and Replacement streamlit web app. Here I used Uses rembg with advanced options (alpha_matting, thresholds), Streamlit UI is well-organized: upload, preview, process, replace, Uses Image.alpha_composite for seamless background overlay, Proper file saving and user feedback (st.success, st.error) etc.
